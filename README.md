# Glow_LED_with_push_button

## Components:
- LED Light
- Resistors (220 ohms for LED, 10K ohms for Push Button)
- Push Button of two or four Legs
- Male to Male Jumper Wires
- Arduino

## Explanation:
- Connect Anode of LED with resistor of 220 ohms.
- Connect the other leg of resistor with Pin 2 of Arduino.
- Connect Cathode of LED with GND of Arduino.
- Connect one leg of push button with 5V of Arduino.
- Connect one leg with Resistor of 10K and coonect the other leg of resistor with GND of Arduino.
- Do the coding part and then upload it on Arduino.
